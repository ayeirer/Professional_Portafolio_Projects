Sales report and Forecast from a company
I developed a dashboard and a dynamic Forecast for diverse sources of data in excel. 
The Data has three channels for each one many consumers and a registration on a period, 
products selected by the consumer, a binary of affiliations. 
Where I did with the forecast is considering actual sales amount and calculate the new goal for each channel and 
depending on that the power Bi calculates forecast filter the specifications that the operator wants.
